			<p><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Lantz Weaver, and I am an up and coming web developer. I am originally from Camden, South Carolina. I graduated from Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with an International Business Concentration in the Spring of 2016. As an Undergraduate, I was very involved on campus as a Resident Assistant, the Winthrop University Quidditch Team President, and various other leadership roles including many within the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, I am team member of Penn Station: East Coast Subs in Rock Hill, SC. My previous work experience includes time as an I.T. Assistant at Wells Fargo Advisors-Camden Financial Partners, LLC, a Resident Assistant and Desk Host for Winthrop University Residence Life, and a Customer Service Representative for LPL Financial. I have also taken part in multiple volunteer oportunities including serving as a Youth Leader at my church, serving as Treasurer for the Pi Kappa Phi-Epsilon Eta Housing Corporation, Inc., and  managing the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity house.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my free time, I enjoy travelling, hiking, golfing, reading, and watching sitcoms such as "Freinds," "The Office," and "Parks and Recreation." I have been to 5 different continents and 19 different Countries.</p>
